Please find below a starting place to begin working on our project proposal (taken from the ideas discussed at our initial Zoom). Let's work on fleshing this out, and getting everything finalized so we can have a robust proposal to work from starting Monday! 


Genres, ratings, runtime from
1990-2000
2000-2010
2010-current
“We live in a box of space and time. Movies are windows in its walls.” - Roger Ebert
“Life imitates art far more than art imitates life” - Oscar Wilde
Whether art acts as a harbinger, mirror, or influencer is a matter better left to the philosophers. But regardless of where you land, it is clear that art changes with the times. The most widely consumed art of our generation is that of movies and shows. There are an estimated 5.41 Billion television viewers in 2022. And far and above the most common method of viewing is the increasingly popular streaming services. In  2022, over 85% of U.S. households have at least one video streaming subscription.
Our team has compiled data from several key streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, and Crunchy Roll to examine how time has influenced trends in media. We examined 3 decades of data: 1990-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010- today. Answering the questions:
How have movie times changed over the decades?
What were the most popular genres of each decade?
Have popularity ratings increased or decreased over time?
Have shows airing times changed throughout the decades?
How do streaming ‘originals’ compare in ratings to other movies?
I would LOVE to create some kind of a predictive model to go along with our questions. What's kind of model can we build?
