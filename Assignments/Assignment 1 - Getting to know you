What does this team member consider his or her strengths?
I am good at communicating and big-picture planning. I feel like I am pretty solid in running analytics and knowing which tests to perform. 
What does this team member consider his or her weaknesses?
I am not great at recoding/wrangling and my coding skills in general are rudimentary. 
How does this team member feel he or she works best? This could be anything from the time of day he or she likes to work to the type of work he or she likes to do, the resources he or she frequently utilizes, or even the best way to communicate with him or her.
I work in the mornings and I like to work fast and get lots done. I am free for meetings later in the day but I do all my coding and actual work before 1pm. 
How would the team member like to receive feedback? In an ideal world, feedback would be primarily good - everyone is tackling their assigned tasks with aplomb. But sometimes, things don't run as smoothly. Having a plan in place ahead of time to have these hard conversations is smart!
I am very open to feedback, just make sure it is specific and clear.
