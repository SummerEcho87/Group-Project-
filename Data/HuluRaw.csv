It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia features Mac, Dennis, Charlie, Sweet Dee and Frank, five ne’er-do-wells who own and operate Paddy’s Pub in Philadelphia. Their constant scheming usually lands them in a world of hurt, yet they never seem to learn from their mistakes. As they say, some things never change. So prepare for more depraved schemes, half-baked arguments and absurdly underhanded plots to subvert one another.

It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia was created by Rob McElhenney and is executive produced by Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, Michael Rotenberg, Nicholas Frenkel, Tom Lofaro, Rob Rosell, Scott Marder and David Hornsby.
